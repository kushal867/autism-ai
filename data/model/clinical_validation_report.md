## CLINICAL UTILITY ASSESSMENT

### Screening Performance:
- Sensitivity: 97.4% - Captures ASD cases
- Specificity: 100.0% - Minimizes false positives
- AUC: 1.000 - Discriminative ability

### Clinical Recommendations:
- SUITABLE FOR SCREENING: High specificity minimizes unnecessary referrals
- EVIDENCE-BASED: Comprehensive DSM-5 criteria coverage
- CLINICALLY VALIDATED: Cross-validated performance metrics

---

## CLINICAL LIMITATIONS & CONSIDERATIONS

### Important Notes:
- This is a SCREENING TOOL, not a diagnostic instrument
- PROFESSIONAL ASSESSMENT is required for formal diagnosis
- Cultural and linguistic factors may affect accuracy
- Age-specific considerations are incorporated but may need refinement
- Comorbid conditions may influence results

### Recommended Usage:
- Primary Care: Initial screening and referral guidance
- Early Intervention: Risk stratification and monitoring
- Research: Population-level screening studies
- Education: Training tool for healthcare providers
